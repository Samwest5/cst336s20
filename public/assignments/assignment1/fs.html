            <p>A file system in the contex of an Operating System is the control system that contains the methods and policies of how files are stored on disk/storage.<br>
            The typical file system is a tree structure where there are folders nested within folders and files can be in any of the folders.<br>
            On the physical storage device, these items are not stored consecutively or not necesarily near each other. Everything is handled by pointers to different locations on disk.<br>
            The actual locations are abstracted away in the form of files and directories, this makes it simpiler for the end user to use as well as for the developer to program for.</p>
