            <p>This site provides an extremely brief introduction to Operating Systems and some of the main concepts behind them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>An Operating System, such as Windows or MacOS, is tool that allows for a computing device to be simpiler to use and program.<br>
            The main component of the Operating System is the Kernel.<br>
            The Kernel is the piece of software that interfaces directly with the hardware components.<br>
            Some of the most important components of the Kernel are those of <a href = "proc.html"><u>process management</u></a>, <a href = "mem.html"><u>memory management</u></a>, and <a href = "proc.html"><u>file systems</u></a>.<br>
            Due to the complexity of computers these days (there is a multidtude of different components that go inside a computer and even when the same models are being compared,<br>
            there is no guarentee the have the exact same configuration)it has become necessary for there to be a unified system that developers can target otherwise each developer<br>
            would have to know the exact configuration and would not be able to have slightly portible code.<br>
            Another benefit of this is modern day Operating Systems also have the user in mind and bundle different Desktop Enviroments that allow users to navigate and make full<br>
            use of the system which increases use-ability for the general public.</p>
