            <p>Memory Management in the contex of an Operating System is where the Kernel efficenitly maximizes the usage of memory that is availabe in the system.<br>
            The memory manager will ensure that the<small> memory for each process will be sandboxed. This also helps with security </small>in addtion to the efficent use of resources.<br>
            By having memory seperated, processes will only allocate as much memory as they need and not consume all memory in the system. This is also helpful as programmers will be able to not worry about<br>
            other processes using the same memory locations that they are using for their own applications.
