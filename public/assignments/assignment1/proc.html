            <p>Process management is the task of managing all processes that are running on a computer.<br>
            Modern computers are fast enough to preform multiple tasks simultaniously. If the computer only preformed one task at a time, it would be a waste of resources.<br>
            Kernels have what  is called a scheduler. The scheduler is  responsible for ensuring that the CPU's time is used  efficiently and is shared with all processes running.<br>
            If the scheduler were to allow for one process to hog up all the resources, then the CPU would be  idle and unresponsive.<br>
            The method that is used today is that of time-slicing which is where the amount of time a process is allocated to a hardware thead is minisule then it is kicked off while another task is preformed.<br>
            Not only is time-slicing incorporated, there are also various methods of selecting which process is run next which is the actual scheudler. The scheduler decides priority for each task and<br>
            puts each task in a priority queue. This queue is the ordering of which tasks will be selected to run next based off of the efficieny of the CPU's resources and time.</p>
